# Movie-Review-sentiments-analysis

The primary goal of this project is to create a sentiment analysis model that can automatically 
identify movie reviews as positive or negative based on the sentiment indicated in the text. The 
goal is to develop a tool that uses natural language processing techniques and machine learning 
algorithms to let consumers rapidly assess the overall sentiment of movie review.
